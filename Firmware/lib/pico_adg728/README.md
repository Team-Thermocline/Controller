# ADG728 Library for Pi Pico

There wasn't an already existing library for the pico SDK for the ADG728, but! There was one for arduino curated by [RobTillaart](https://github.com/RobTillaart). Please see his original library [here](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADG728) as i used it for inspiration when writing an implementation here.
